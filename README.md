## Features
I once saw something like this some years ago. Unfortunately I don't remember where, but since I
always wanted it, I'm building it now.

- Choose from preconfigured colors
- Choose width from preconfigured set
- Configure your own color and width with a `custom` style.
- Toggle colors.

## Configuration
Unfortunately, the Atom API limits the specific markers for this plugin, so the easiest way to set
this style was with a static `stylesheet`.

1. Choose one of the preconfigured color in the Package configuration.
2. Create your own set of colors by adding something like this in `Atom -> Stylesheet...` and then
choose the `custom` option in the package configuration for `colors`.
```less
.color-indent {
  &.color-indent-0 {
    &.custom {
      border-right-color: #bce784;
    }
  }

  &.color-indent-1 {
    &.custom {
      border-right-color: #5dd39e;
    }
  }

  &.color-indent-2 {
    &.custom {
      border-right-color: #348aa7;
    }
  }

  &.color-indent-3 {
    &.custom {
    border-right-color: #525174;
    }
  }

  &.color-indent-4 {
    &.custom {
      border-right-color: #513b56;
    }
  }
}
```
2. Create your own width by adding something like this in `Atom -> Stylesheet...` and then
choose the `custom` option in the package configuration for `width`.
```less
.color-indent {
  &.color-indent-width-custom {
    border-right-width: 6px;
  }
}
```

### Gutter
![No space](https://i.imgur.com/7Vtbkrm.png)

Some packages, like `eslint` create a Gutter in Atom. That means that the style for `color-indent`
and the actual code have a space between each other. However, if there are no packages that do this, you can
enable this to add an space and avoid having this problem.

If you want, you can even change the gutter style like this in `Atom -> Stylesheet...`
```less
.gutter[gutter-name="color-indent"] {
    min-width: 10px;
}
```

## Usage
Just type and see how the tabulation color is filled.

You can also toggle the colors if you need to deactivate it or reactivate it quickly.
Go to the Atom Command Palette and choose `color-indent: toggle`.
