## Installation

You can install via `apm`:
```sh
apm install color-indent
```

Or, just search for `color-indent` inside Atom's package panel.

## Features
I once saw something like this some years ago. Unfortunately I don't remember where, but since I
always wanted it, I'm building it now.

- Choose your own color.
- Use a custom width.
- Choose identation depth.

## Usage
Just type and see how the tabulation color is filled.

You can also toggle the colors if you need to deactivate it or reactivate it quickly.
Go to the Atom Command Palette and choose `color-indent: toggle`.
